### Inter malleum et incudem — Between the hammer and the anvil
> *I spent over 35 years as a successful Construction Project Manager and business owner, leading business development and operations in the industry. That was until an accident—a fall from a ladder—changed my trajectory. Now, I'm shifting gears and looking to pivot into the IT and Cybersecurity sector, ready to apply my skills, experience, and determination to a new challenge.*

### A good anvil does not fear the hammer
> *resilience and adaptability*

### It is better to be the hammer than the anvil
> *individual agency over inaction*

### I haven't decided yet if I am more of a hammer, an anvil, or that wrought between them...
