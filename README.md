### Inter malleum et incudem — Between the hammer and the anvil
  - *I was a successful construction Project Manager and Owner, with 35+ years in business
development and operations, until I fell from a ladder. Now I'm seeking to pivot careers to the IT and Cybersecurity sector*

### A good anvil does not fear the hammer
  - *resilience and adaptability in the face of life’s challenges*

### It is better to be the hammer than the anvil
  - *individual agency over passiveness*

### I haven't decided yet if I am more hammer, or anvil, or that wrought between
  
*Michael Leone*
